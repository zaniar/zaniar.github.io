title: Some Old Posts are Back
---
Finally, I uploaded some old posts from my old WordPreas blog. Still not all of it though. Some posts need editing so they will displayed properly in Jekyll. The most notable issue is the images. I need to work on them, so I am not import them right now. Well, I already noticed that an still-need-to-edit post sliped out.

As you may noticed, the old posts are not written in English. They are written in Indonesian language. I am still not sure whether I am going to translate it to English or not.
