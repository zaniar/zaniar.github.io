Hi! Welcome to my new personal blog. This is my first experience having blog on [GitHub Pages](http://github.com/pages). This is also my first experience using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Before, I had experience with self-hosted [WordPress](http://wordpress.com), moving from one web hosting to another.

I would like to thank [GitHub](http://github.com) for the great site hosting service, [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) for the great blogging platform, and [Poole](http://getpoole.com) as well as [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com) for the great template.
