title: My Old Domain Name is Back
---

It's been a while since I use [zaniar.web.id](http://zaniar.web.id) as my domain name. Around a year if my memory serve me right. Back then, this domain point to a site backed by self-hosted [WordPress](http://wordpress.org).

I'm planning to get my old posts on WordPress to be imported to this [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)-powered site. Ah! I'm also still can't decide what comment system to be installed here. I hope to see you around when the comment system installed.
